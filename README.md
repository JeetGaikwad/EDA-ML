### The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997-2011 dataset is one of the most important databases available to social scientists working with US data.

***The NLSY97 collects extensive information on respondents' labor market behavior and educational experiences. The survey also includes data on the youths' family and community backgrounds to help researchers assess the impact of schooling and other environmental factors on these labor market entrants.***
